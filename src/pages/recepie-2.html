                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hot dog sausages</li>
                    <li>Hot dog buns</li>
                    <li>Your choice of condiments (ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, etc.)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cooking steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prepare the hot dog sausages:</strong> Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium heat. Place the hot dog sausages on the skillet or grill pan and cook them for about 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are heated through and have nice grill marks on all sides. You can also grill them on an outdoor grill if you prefer.</li>

                    <li><strong>Warm the hot dog buns: </strong>While the sausages are cooking, you can warm the hot dog buns. You can do this by placing them on the grill or in a toaster oven for a minute or two until they are slightly toasted and warm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assemble the hot dogs:</strong> Once the sausages and buns are ready, place the cooked sausages inside the warmed buns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add your favorite condiments:</strong> Now it's time to customize your hot dog with your favorite condiments. Add ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, or any other toppings you like.</li>
                    <li><strong>Serve and enjoy:</strong> Your hot dogs are now ready to be enjoyed! Serve them with some chips, coleslaw, or your favorite side dish, and enjoy a delicious meal.</li>
                    <li>Pancakes are ready to eat</li>
                </ol>

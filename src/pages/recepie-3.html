                    <li>1/2 cup rolled oats</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup frozen raspberries</li>

                </ul>

                <h3>Cooking steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prepare the oats: </strong> In a bowl, add the rolled oats. You can use instant oats if you prefer a quicker cooking time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add yogurt: </strong>Spoon the plain yogurt over the oats. You can use Greek yogurt for extra creaminess and protein.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add frozen raspberries: </strong> Sprinkle the frozen raspberries over the yogurt and oats mixture. The frozen raspberries will add a refreshing burst of flavor and texture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sprinkle with chia seeds: </strong>Finish off the dish by sprinkling chia seeds on top. Chia seeds are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and protein, making them a nutritious addition to any meal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Let it sit:</strong> Allow the oats, yogurt, raspberries, and chia seeds to sit for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together and the oats to soften slightly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Serve and enjoy: </strong>Once the oats have softened to your liking, give everything a gentle stir to combine. Enjoy your delicious and nutritious oats with yogurt, frozen raspberries, and chia seeds!</li>
